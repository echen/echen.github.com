  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ4Ntg4jQHw">this movie visualization</a> for a case study on how a post propagates through Quora.</p>

<p>How does information spread through a network? Much of Quora&#8217;s appeal, after all, lies in its social graph &#8211; and when you&#8217;ve got a network of users, all broadcasting their activities to their neighbors, information can cascade in multiple ways. How do these social designs affect which users see what?</p>

<p>Think, for example, of what happens when your kid learns a new slang word at school. He doesn&#8217;t confine his use of the word to McKinley Elementary&#8217;s particular boundaries, between the times of 9-3pm &#8211; he introduces it to his friends from other schools at soccer practice as well. A couple months later, he even says it at home for the first time; you like the word so much, you then start using it at work. Eventually, Justin Bieber uses the word in a song, at which point the word&#8217;s popularity really starts to explode.</p>

<p>So how does information propagate through a social network? What types of people does an answer on Quora reach, and how does it reach them? (Do users discover new answers individually, or are hubs of connectors more key?) How does the activity of a post on Quora rise and fall? (Submissions on other sites have limited lifetimes, fading into obscurity soon after an initial spike; how does that change when users are connected and every upvote can revive a post for someone else&#8217;s eyes?)</p>

<p>(I looked at Quora since I had some data from there already available, but I hope the lessons should be fairly applicable in general, to other social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn as well.)</p>

<p>To give an initial answer to some of these questions, I dug into one of my more popular posts, on <a href="http://www.quora.com/Random-Forests/How-do-random-forests-work-in-laymans-terms">a layman&#8217;s introduction to random forests</a>.</p>

<h1>Users, Topics</h1>

<p>Before looking deeper into the voting dynamics of the post, let&#8217;s first get some background on what kinds of users the answer reached.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a graph of the topics that question upvoters follow. (Each node is a topic, and every time upvoter X follows both topics A and B, I add an edge between A and B.)</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoter-topics-unlabeled.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoter-topics-unlabeled.png" alt="Upvoters' Topics - Unlabeled" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoter-topics-labeled.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoter-topics-labeled.png" alt="Upvoters' Topics - Labeled" /></a></p>

<p>We can see from the graph that upvoters tend to be interested in three kinds of topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Machine learning and other technical matters</strong> (the green cluster): Classification, Data Mining, Big Data, Information Retrieval, Analytics, Probability, Support Vector Machines, R, Data Science, &#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Startups/Silicon Valley</strong> (the red cluster): Facebook, Lean Startups, Investing, Seed Funding, Angel Investing, Technology Trends, Product Managment, Silicon Valley Mergers and Acquisitions, Asana, Social Games, Quora, Mark Zuckerberg, User Experience, Founders and Entrepreneurs, &#8230;</li>
<li><strong>General Intellectual Topics</strong> (the purple cluster): TED, Science, Book Recommendations, Philosophy, Politics, Self-Improvement, Travel, Life Hacks, &#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, here&#8217;s the network of the upvoters themselves (there&#8217;s an edge between users A and B if A follows B):</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoters-unlabeled.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoters-unlabeled.png" alt="Upvote Network - Unlabeled" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoters-labeled.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoters-labeled.png" alt="Upvote Network - Labeled" /></a></p>

<p>We can see three main clusters of users:</p>

<ul>
<li>A large group in <strong>green</strong> centered around a lot of power users and Quora employees.</li>
<li>A machine learning group of folks in <strong>orange</strong> centered around people like Oliver Grisel, Christian Langreiter, and Joseph Turian.</li>
<li>A group of people following me, in <strong>purple</strong>.</li>
<li>Plus some smaller clusters in blue and yellow. (There were also a bunch of isolated users, connected to no one, that I filtered out of the picture.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Digging into how these topic and user graphs are related:</p>

<ul>
<li>The orange cluster of users is more heavily into machine learning: 79% of users in that cluster follow more green topics (machine learning and technical topics) than red and purple topics (startups and general intellectual matters).</li>
<li>The green cluster of users is reversed: 77% of users follow more of the red and purple clusters of topics (on startups and general intellectual matters) than machine learning and technical topics.</li>
</ul>


<p>More interestingly, though, we can ask: how do the connections between upvoters relate to the way the post spread?</p>

<h1>Social Voting Dynamics</h1>

<p>So let&#8217;s take a look. Here&#8217;s a visualization I made of upvotes on my answer across time (click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ4Ntg4jQHw">here</a> for a larger view).</p>

<iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cZ4Ntg4jQHw " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p></p>

<p>To represent the social dynamics of these upvotes, I drew an edge from user A to user B if user A transmitted the post to user B through an upvote. (Specifically, I drew an edge from Alice to Bob if Bob follows Alice and Bob&#8217;s upvote appeared within five days of Alice&#8217;s upvote; this is meant to simulate the idea that Alice was the key intermediary between my post and Bob.)</p>

<p>Also,</p>

<ul>
<li>Green nodes are users with at least one upvote edge.</li>
<li>Blue nodes are users who follow at least one of the topics the post is categorized under (i.e., users who probably discovered the answer by themselves).</li>
<li>Red nodes are users with no connections and who do not follow any of the post&#8217;s topics (i.e, users whose path to the post remain mysterious).</li>
<li>Users increase in size when they produce more connections.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s a play-by-play of the video:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Feb 14 (the day I wrote the answer), there&#8217;s a flurry of activity.</li>
<li>A couple of days later, Tracy Chou gives an upvote, leading to another spike in activity.</li>
<li>Then all&#8217;s quiet until&#8230; bam! Alex Kamil leads to a surge of upvotes, and his upvote finds Ludi Rehak, who starts a small surge of her own. They&#8217;re quickly followed by Christian Langreiter, who starts a small revolution among a bunch of machine learning folks a couple days later.</li>
<li>Then all is pretty calm again, until a couple months later when&#8230; bam! Aditya Sengupta brings in a smashing of his own followers, and his upvote makes its way to Marc Bodnick, who sets off a veritable storm of activity.</li>
</ul>


<p>(Already we can see some relationships between the graph of user connections and the way the post propagated. Many of the users from the orange cluster, for example, come from Alex Kamil and Christian Langreiter&#8217;s upvotes, and many of the users from the green cluster come from Aditya Sengupta and Marc Bodnick&#8217;s upvotes. What&#8217;s interesting, though, is, why didn&#8217;t the cluster of green users appear all at once, like the orange cluster did? People like Kah Seng Tay, Tracy Chou, Venkatesh Rao, and Chad Little upvoted the answer pretty early on, but it wasn&#8217;t until Aditya Sengupta&#8217;s upvote a couple months later that people like Marc Bodnick, Edmond Lau, and many of the other green users (who do indeed follow that first set of folks) discovered the answer. Did the post simply get lost in users&#8217; feeds the first time around? Was the post perhaps ignored until it received enough upvotes to be considered worth reading? Are some users&#8217; upvotes just trusted more than others&#8217;?)</p>

<p>For another view of the upvote dynamics, here&#8217;s a static visualization, where we can again easily see the clusters of activity:</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/upvote-clusters-labeled-v2.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/upvote-clusters-labeled-v2.png" alt="Upvote Temporal Clusters" /></a></p>

<h1>Fin</h1>

<p>There are still many questions it would be interesting to look at; for example,</p>

<ul>
<li>What differentiates users who sparked spikes of activity from users who didn&#8217;t? I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s simply number of followers, as many well-connected upvoters did <em>not</em> lead to cascades of shares. Does authority matter?</li>
<li>How far can a post reach? Clearly, the post reached people more than one degree of separation away from me (where one degree of separation is a follower); what does the distribution of degrees look like? Is there any relationship between degree of separation and time of upvote?</li>
<li>What can we say about the people who started following me after reading my answer? Are they fewer degrees of separation away? Are they more interested in machine learning? Have they upvoted any of my answers before? (Perhaps there&#8217;s a certain &#8220;threshold&#8221; of interestingness people need to overflow before they&#8217;re considered acceptable followees.)</li>
</ul>


<p>But to summarize a bit what we&#8217;ve seen so far, here are some statistics on the role the social graph played in spreading the post:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are 5 clusters of activity after the initial post, sparked both by power users and less-connected folks. In an interesting cascade of information, some of these sparks led to further spikes in activity as well (as when Aditya Sengupta&#8217;s upvote found its way to Marc Bodnick, who set off even more activity).</li>
<li>35% of users made their way to my answer because of someone else&#8217;s upvote.</li>
<li>Through these connections, the post reached a fair variety of users: 32% of upvoters don&#8217;t even follow any of the post&#8217;s topics.</li>
<li>77% of upvotes came from users over two weeks <em>after</em> my answer appeared.</li>
<li>If we look only at the upvoters who follow at least one of the post&#8217;s topics, 33% didn&#8217;t see my answer until someone else showed it to them. In other words, a full one-third of people who presumably would have been interested in my post anyways only found it because of their social network.</li>
</ul>


<p>So it looks like the social graph played quite a large part in the post&#8217;s propagation, and I&#8217;ll end with a big shoutout to Stormy Shippy, who provided an awesome set of scripts I used to collect a lot of this data.</p>

<time datetime="2011-08-22T10:50:49-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 22<span>nd</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Suppose you have the following set of sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>I like to eat broccoli and bananas.</li>
<li>I ate a banana and spinach smoothie for breakfast.</li>
<li>Chinchillas and kittens are cute.</li>
<li>My sister adopted a kitten yesterday.</li>
<li>Look at this cute hamster munching on a piece of broccoli.</li>
</ul>


<p>What is latent Dirichlet allocation? It&#8217;s a way of automatically discovering <strong>topics</strong> that these sentences contain. For example, given these sentences and asked for 2 topics, LDA might produce something like</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sentences 1 and 2</strong>: 100% Topic A</li>
<li><strong>Sentences 3 and 4</strong>: 100% Topic B</li>
<li><strong>Sentence 5</strong>: 60% Topic A, 40% Topic B</li>
<li><strong>Topic A</strong>: 30% broccoli, 15% bananas, 10% breakfast, 10% munching, &#8230; (at which point, you could interpret topic A to be about food)</li>
<li><strong>Topic B</strong>: 20% chinchillas, 20% kittens, 20% cute, 15% hamster, &#8230; (at which point, you could interpret topic B to be about cute animals)</li>
</ul>


<p>The question, of course, is: how does LDA perform this discovery?</p>

<h1>LDA Model</h1>

<p>In more detail, LDA represents documents as <strong>mixtures of topics</strong> that spit out words with certain probabilities. It assumes that documents are produced in the following fashion: when writing each document, you</p>

<ul>
<li>Decide on the number of words N the document will have (say, according to a Poisson distribution).</li>
<li>Choose a topic mixture for the document (according to a Dirichlet distribution over a fixed set of K topics). For example, assuming that we have the two food and cute animal topics above, you might choose the document to consist of 1/3 food and 2/3 cute animals.</li>
<li>Generate each word w_i in the document by:

<ul>
<li>First picking a topic (according to the multinomial distribution that you sampled above; for example, you might pick the food topic with 1/3 probability and the cute animals topic with 2/3 probability).</li>
<li>Using the topic to generate the word itself (according to the topic&#8217;s multinomial distribution). For example, if we selected the food topic, we might generate the word &#8220;broccoli&#8221; with 30% probability, &#8220;bananas&#8221; with 15% probability, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Assuming this generative model for a collection of documents, LDA then tries to backtrack from the documents to find a set of topics that are likely to have generated the collection.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s make an example. According to the above process, when generating some particular document D, you might</p>

<ul>
<li>Pick 5 to be the number of words in D.</li>
<li>Decide that D will be 1/2 about food and 1/2 about cute animals.</li>
<li>Pick the first word to come from the food topic, which then gives you the word &#8220;broccoli&#8221;.</li>
<li>Pick the second word to come from the cute animals topic, which gives you &#8220;panda&#8221;.</li>
<li>Pick the third word to come from the cute animals topic, giving you &#8220;adorable&#8221;.</li>
<li>Pick the fourth word to come from the food topic, giving you &#8220;cherries&#8221;.</li>
<li>Pick the fifth word to come from the food topic, giving you &#8220;eating&#8221;.</li>
</ul>


<p>So the document generated under the LDA model will be &#8220;broccoli panda adorable cherries eating&#8221; (note that LDA is a bag-of-words model).</p>

<h1>Learning</h1>

<p>So now suppose you have a set of documents. You&#8217;ve chosen some fixed number of K topics to discover, and want to use LDA to learn the topic representation of each document and the words associated to each topic. How do you do this? One way (known as collapsed Gibbs sampling) is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go through each document, and randomly assign each word in the document to one of the K topics.</li>
<li>Notice that this random assignment already gives you both topic representations of all the documents and word distributions of all the topics (albeit not very good ones).</li>
<li>So to improve on them, for each document d&#8230;

<ul>
<li>Go through each word w in d&#8230;

<ul>
<li>And for each topic t, compute two things: 1) p(topic t | document d) = the proportion of words in document d that are currently assigned to topic t, and 2) p(word w | topic t) = the proportion of assignments to topic t over all documents that come from this word w. Reassign w a new topic, where we choose topic t with probability p(topic t | document d) * p(word w | topic t) (according to our generative model, this is essentially the probability that topic t generated word w, so it makes sense that we resample the current word&#8217;s topic with this probability). (Also, I&#8217;m glossing over a couple of things here, in particular the use of priors/pseudocounts in these probabilities.)</li>
<li>In other words, in this step, we&#8217;re assuming that all topic assignments except for the current word in question are correct, and then updating the assignment of the current word using our model of how documents are generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After repeating the previous step a large number of times, you&#8217;ll eventually reach a roughly steady state where your assignments are pretty good. So use these assignments to estimate the topic mixtures of each document (by counting the proportion of words assigned to each topic within that document) and the words associated to each topic (by counting the proportion of words assigned to each topic overall).</li>
</ul>


<h1>Layman&#8217;s Explanation</h1>

<p>In case the discussion above was a little eye-glazing, here&#8217;s another way to look at LDA in a different domain.</p>

<p>Suppose you&#8217;ve just moved to a new city. You&#8217;re a hipster and an anime fan, so you want to know where the other hipsters and anime geeks tend to hang out. Of course, as a hipster, you know you can&#8217;t just <em>ask</em>, so what do you do?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the scenario: you scope out a bunch of different establishments (<strong>documents</strong>) across town, making note of the people (<strong>words</strong>) hanging out in each of them (e.g., Alice hangs out at the mall and at the park, Bob hangs out at the movie theater and the park, and so on). Crucially, you don&#8217;t know the typical interest groups (<strong>topics</strong>) of each establishment, nor do you know the different interests of each person.</p>

<p>So you pick some number K of categories to learn (i.e., you want to learn the K most important kinds of categories people fall into), and start by making a guess as to why you see people where you do. For example, you initially guess that Alice is at the mall because people with interests in X like to hang out there; when you see her at the park, you guess it&#8217;s because her friends with interests in Y like to hang out there; when you see Bob at the movie theater, you randomly guess it&#8217;s because the Z people in this city really like to watch movies; and so on.</p>

<p>Of course, your random guesses are very likely to be incorrect (they&#8217;re random guesses, after all!), so you want to improve on them. One way of doing so is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pick a place and a person (e.g., Alice at the mall).</li>
<li>Why is Alice likely to be at the mall? Probably because other people at the mall with the same interests sent her a message telling her to come.</li>
<li>In other words, the more people with interests in X there are at the mall and the stronger Alice is associated with interest X (at all the other places she goes to), the more likely it is that Alice is at the mall because of interest X.</li>
<li>So make a new guess as to why Alice is at the mall, choosing an interest with some probability according to how likely you think it is.</li>
</ul>


<p>Go through each place and person over and over again. Your guesses keep getting better and better (after all, if you notice that lots of geeks hang out at the bookstore, and you suspect that Alice is pretty geeky herself, then it&#8217;s a good bet that Alice is at the bookstore because her geek friends told her to go there; and now that you have a better idea of why Alice is probably at the bookstore, you can use this knowledge in turn to improve your guesses as to why everyone else is where they are), and eventually you can stop updating. Then take a snapshot (or multiple snapshots) of your guesses, and use it to get all the information you want:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each category, you can count the people assigned to that category to figure out what people have this particular interest. By looking at the people themselves, you can interpret the category as well (e.g., if category X contains lots of tall people wearing jerseys and carrying around basketballs, you might interpret X as the &#8220;basketball players&#8221; group).</li>
<li>For each place P and interest category C, you can compute the proportions of people at P because of C (under the current set of assignments), and these give you a representation of P. For example, you might learn that the people who hang out at Barnes &amp; Noble consist of 10% hipsters, 50% anime fans, 10% jocks, and 30% college students.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Real-World Example</h1>

<p>Finally, I applied LDA to a set of Sarah Palin&#8217;s emails a little while ago (see <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2011/06/27/topic-modeling-the-sarah-palin-emails/">here</a> for the blog post, or <a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/">here</a> for an app that allows you to browse through the emails by the LDA-learned categories), so let&#8217;s give a brief recap. Here are some of the topics that the algorithm learned:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Trig/Family/Inspiration</strong>: family, web, mail, god, son, from, congratulations, children, life, child, down, trig, baby, birth, love, you, syndrome, very, special, bless, old, husband, years, thank, best, &#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Wildlife/BP Corrosion</strong>: game, fish, moose, wildlife, hunting, bears, polar, bear, subsistence, management, area, board, hunt, wolves, control, department, year, use, wolf, habitat, hunters, caribou, program, denby, fishing, &#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Energy/Fuel/Oil/Mining:</strong> energy, fuel, costs, oil, alaskans, prices, cost, nome, now, high, being, home, public, power, mine, crisis, price, resource, need, community, fairbanks, rebate, use, mining, villages, &#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Gas</strong>: gas, oil, pipeline, agia, project, natural, north, producers, companies, tax, company, energy, development, slope, production, resources, line, gasline, transcanada, said, billion, plan, administration, million, industry, &#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Education/Waste</strong>: school, waste, education, students, schools, million, read, email, market, policy, student, year, high, news, states, program, first, report, business, management, bulletin, information, reports, 2008, quarter, &#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Presidential Campaign/Elections</strong>: mail, web, from, thank, you, box, mccain, sarah, very, good, great, john, hope, president, sincerely, wasilla, work, keep, make, add, family, republican, support, doing, p.o, &#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s an example of an email which fell 99% into the Trig/Family/Inspiration category (particularly representative words are highlighted in blue):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It always strikes me as curious that some posts get a lot of love on Twitter, while others get many more shares on Facebook:</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/twitter-beats-fb.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/twitter-beats-fb.png" alt="Twitter Beats FB" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/fb-beats-twitter.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/fb-beats-twitter.png" alt="FB Beats Twitter" /></a></p>

<p>What accounts for this difference? Some of it is surely site-dependent: maybe one blogger has a Facebook page but not a Twitter account, while another has these roles reversed. But even on sites maintained by a single author, tweet-to-likes ratios can vary widely from post to post.</p>

<p>So what kinds of articles tend to be more popular on Twitter, and which spread more easily on Facebook? To take a stab at an answer, I scraped data from a couple of websites over the weekend.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Twitter is still for the <em>techies</em>: articles where the number of tweets greatly outnumber FB likes tend to revolve around software companies and programming. Facebook, on the other hand, appeals to <em>everyone else</em>: yeah, to the masses, and to non-software technical folks in general as well.</p>

<h1>FlowingData</h1>

<p>The first site I looked at was Nathan Yau&#8217;s awesome <a href="http://www.flowingdata.com">FlowingData</a> website on data visualization. To see which articles are more popular on Facebook and which are more popular on Twitter, let&#8217;s sort all the FlowingData articles by their # tweets / # likes ratio.</p>

<p>Here are the 10 posts with the lowest tweets-to-likes ratio (i.e., the posts that were especially popular with Facebook users):</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-facebook2.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-facebook2-small.png" alt="FlowingData Facebook" /></a></p>

</ul>


<p>And here are the 10 posts with the highest tweets-to-like ratio (i.e., the posts especially popular with Twitter users):</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-twitter.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-twitter-small.png" alt="FlowingData Twitter" /></a></p>

</ul>


<p>Notice any differences between the two?</p>

<ul>
<li>Instant gratification infographics, cuteness, comics, and pop culture get liked on Facebook.</li>
<li>APIs, datasets, visualizations related to techie sites (Delicious, foursquare, Twitter, LinkedIn), and picture-less articles get tweeted instead.</li>
</ul>


<p>Interestingly, it also looks like the colors in the top 10 Facebook articles tend to the red end of the spectrum, while the colors in the top 10 Twitter articles tend to the blue end of the spectrum. Does this pattern hold if we look at more data? Here&#8217;s a meta-visualization of the FlowingData articles, sorted by articles popular on Facebook in the top left to articles popular on Twitter in the bottom right (see <a href="http://flowingdata-melted.heroku.com/">here</a> for some interactivity and more details):</p>

<p><a href="http://flowingdata-melted.heroku.com/"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/flowingdata-metaviz/flowingdata-metaviz.png" alt="FlowingData MetaViz" /></a></p>

<p>It does indeed look like the images at the top (the articles popular on Facebook) are more pink, while the images at the bottom (the articles popular on Twitter) are more blue (though it would be nice to quantify this in some way)!</p>

<p>Furthermore, we can easily see from the grid that articles with no visualizations (represented by lorem ipsum text in the grid) cluster at the bottom. Grabbing some actual numbers, we find that 32% of articles with at least one picture have more shares on Facebook than on Twitter, compared to only 4% of articles with no picture at all.</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-viz-effect.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-viz-effect.png" alt="Effect of a visualization" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, let&#8217;s break down the percentage of articles with more Facebook shares by category.</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-categories.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-categories.png" alt="FlowingData Categories" /></a></p>

<p>(I filtered the categories so that each category in the plot above contains at least 5 articles.)</p>

<p>What do we find?</p>

<ul>
<li>Articles in the Software, Online Applications, News, and Data sources categories (yawn) get 100% of their shares from Twitter.</li>
<li>Articles tagged with <a href="http://flowingdata.com/category/projects/data-underload/">Data Underload</a> (which seems to contain short and sweet visualizations of everyday things), <a href="http://flowingdata.com/category/miscellaneous-data/">Miscellaneous</a> (which contains lots of comics or comic-like visualizations), and <a href="http://flowingdata.com/category/visualization/infographics/">Infographics</a> get the most shares on Facebook.</li>
<li>This category breakdown matches precisely what we saw in the top 10 examples above.</li>
</ul>


<h1>New Scientist</h1>

<p>When looking at FlowingData, we saw that Twitter users are much bigger on sharing technical articles. But is this true for technical articles in general, or only for programming-related posts? (In my experience with Twitter, I haven&#8217;t seen many people from math and the non-computer sciences.)</p>

<p>To answer, I took articles from the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/search?rbsection1=Physics+%26+Math&amp;sortby=rbpubdate">Physics &amp; Math</a> and <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/search?rbsection1=tech&amp;sortby=rbpubdate">Technology</a> sections of <a href="http://www.newscientist.com">New Scientist</a>, and</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculated the percentage of shares each article received on Twitter (i.e., # tweets / (# tweets + # likes)).</li>
<li>Grouped articles by their number of tweets rounded to the nearest multiple of 25 (bin #1 contains articles close to 25 tweets, bin #2 contains articles close to 50 tweets, etc.).</li>
<li>Calculated the median percentage of shares on Twitter for each bin.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s a graph of the result:</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/tech_vs_physicsmath.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/tech_vs_physicsmath.png" alt="Technology vs. Physics &amp; Math" /></a></p>

<p>Notice that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The technology articles get consistently more shares from Twitter than the physics and math articles do.</li>
<li>Twitter accounts for the majority of the technology shares.</li>
<li>Facebook accounts for the majority of the physics and math shares.</li>
</ul>


<p>So this suggests that Twitter really is for computer technology in particular, not technical matters in general (though it would be nice to look at areas other than physics and math as well).</p>

<h1>Quora</h1>

<p>To get some additional evidence on the computer science vs. math/physics divide, I</p>

<ul>
<li>Scraped about 350 profiles of followers from each of the Computer Science, Software Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics categories on Quora;</li>
<li>Checked each user to see whether they link to their Facebook and Twitter accounts on their profile.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s the ratio of the number of people linking to their Facebook account to the number of people linking to their Twitter account, sliced by topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/math-physics-vs-cs-software.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/math-physics-vs-cs-software.png" alt="Math/Physics vs. CS/Software" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/math-physics-vs-cs-software-collapsed.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/math-physics-vs-cs-software-collapsed.png" alt="Math/Physics vs. CS/Software, Collapsed" /></a></p>

<p>We find exactly what we expect from the New Scientist data: people following the math and physics categories have noticeably smaller Twitter / Facebook ratios compared to people following the computer science and software engineering categories (i.e., compared to computer scientists and software engineers, mathematicians and physicists are more likely to be on Facebook than on Twitter). What&#8217;s more, this difference is in fact significant: the graphs display individual 90% confidence intervals (which overlap not at all or only slightly), and we do indeed get significance at the 95% level if we look at the differences between categories.</p>

<p>This corroborates the New Scientist evidence that Twitter gets the computer technology shares, while Facebook gets the math and physics shares.</p>

<h1>XKCD</h1>

<p>Finally, let&#8217;s take a look at which XKCD comics are especially popular on Facebook vs. Twitter.</p>

<p>Here are the 10 comics with the highest likes-to-tweets ratio (i.e., the comics especially popular on Facebook):</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/xkcd-facebook.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/xkcd-facebook-small.png" alt="XKCD Facebook" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/846/">Dental Nerve</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/861/">Wisdom Teeth</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/876/">Trapped</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/849/">Complex Conjugate</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/854/">Learning to Cook</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/840/">Serious</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/839/">Explorers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/815/">Mu</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/809/">Los Alamos</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/911/">Magic School Bus</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Here are the 10 comics with the highest tweets-to-likes ratio (i.e., the comics especially popular on Twitter):</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/xkcd-twitter.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/xkcd-twitter-small.png" alt="XKCD Twitter" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/869/">Server Attention Span</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/818/">Illness</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/865/">Nanobots</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/912/">Manual Override</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/908/">The Cloud</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/810/">Constructive</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/887/">Future Timeline</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/844/">Good Code</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/801/">Golden Hammer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/906/">Advertising Discovery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/802/">Online Communities 2</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Note that the XKCD comics popular on Facebook have more of a layman flavor, while the XKCD comics popular on Twitter are much more programming-related:</p>

<ul>
<li>Of the XKCD comics popular on Twitter, one&#8217;s about server attention spans, another&#8217;s about IPv6 addresses, a third is about GNU info pages, another deals with cloud computing, a fifth talks about Java, and the last is about a bunch of techie sites. (This is just like what we saw with the FlowingData visualizations.)</li>
<li>Facebook, on the other hand, gets Ke$ha and Magic School Bus.</li>
<li>And while both top 10&#8217;s contain a flowchart, the one popular on FB is about <em>cooking</em>, while the one popular on Twitter is about <em>code</em>!</li>
<li>What&#8217;s more, if we look at the few technical-ish comics that are more popular on Facebook (the complex conjugate, mu, and Los Alamos comics), we see that they&#8217;re about physics and math, not programming (which matches our findings from the New Scientist articles).</li>
</ul>


<h1>Lesson</h1>

<p>So why should you care? Here&#8217;s one takeaway:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re blogging about technology, programming, and computer science, Twitter is your friend.</li>
<li>But if you&#8217;re blogging about anything else, be it math/physics or pop culture, don&#8217;t rely on a Twitter account alone; your shares are more likely to propagate on Facebook, so make sure to have a Facebook page as well.</li>
</ul>


<h1>What&#8217;s Next?</h1>

<p>The three websites I looked at are all fairly tech-oriented, so it would be nice to gather data from other kinds of websites as well.</p>

<p>And now that we have an idea how Twitter and Facebook compare, the next burning question is surely: <a href="http://finalbossform.com/post/7214184180/google-is-fast-becoming-the-leading-social">what do people share on Google+?!</a></p>

<h1>Addendum</h1>

<p>Let&#8217;s consider the following thought experiment. Suppose you come across the most unpopular article ever written. What will its FB vs. Twitter shares look like? Although no <em>real</em> person will ever share this article, I think Twitter has many more spambots (who tweet out any and every link) than FB does, so maybe unpopular articles will have more tweets than likes by default. Conversely, suppose you come across the most popular article ever written, which everybody wants to share. Then since FB has many more users than Twitter does, maybe popular articles will tend to have more likes than tweets anyways.</p>

<p>Thus, in order to find out which types of articles are <em>especially</em> popular on FB vs. Twitter, instead of looking at tweets-to-likes ratios directly, we could try to remove this baseline popularity effect. (Taking ratios instead of raw number of tweets or raw number of likes is one kind of normalization; this is another.)</p>

<p>So does this scenario (or something similar to it) actually play out in practice?</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-overall-popularity-vs-fb.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-overall-popularity-vs-fb.png" alt="Overall Popularity vs. Facebook" /></a></p>

<p>Here I&#8217;ve plotted the overall popularity of a post (the total number of shares it received on either Twitter or FB) against the percentage of shares on Facebook alone, and we can see that as a post&#8217;s popularity grows, more and more shares do indeed tend to come from Facebook rather than Twitter.</p>

<p>Also, see the posts at the lower end of the popularity scale that are only getting shares on Twitter? Let&#8217;s take a look at the five most unpopular of these:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/03/31/flowingdata-is-brought-to-you-by-8/">Flowing Data is brought to you by&#8230; (March 2011 edition)</a> (11 tweets, 0 likes)</li>
<li><a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/07/05/flowingdata-is-brought-to-you-by-11/">Flowing Data is brought to you by&#8230; (July 2011 edition)</a> (14 tweets, 0 likes)</li>
<li><a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/06/06/flowingdata-is-brought-to-you-by-10/">Flowing Data is brought to you by&#8230; (June 2011 edition)</a> (17 tweets, 0 likes)</li>

<li><a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/02/28/flowingdata-is-brought-to-you-by-7/">Flowing Data is brought to you by&#8230; (May 2011 edition)</a> (12 tweets, 1 like)</li>
</ul>


<p>Notice that they&#8217;re all shoutouts to FlowingData&#8217;s sponsors! There&#8217;s pretty much no reason any <em>real</em> person would share these on Twitter or Facebook, and indeed, checking Twitter to see who actually tweeted out these links, we see that the tweeters are bots:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/myVisualization/status/77685824224894976">https://twitter.com/#!/myVisualization/status/77685824224894976</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/InfographicTwts/status/67668615142457344">https://twitter.com/#!/InfographicTwts/status/6766861514245734</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/guysgoogle/status/77644902510493696">https://twitter.com/#!/guysgoogle/status/77644902510493696</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/WhereIsYourData/status/77631743292735488">https://twitter.com/#!/WhereIsYourData/status/77631743292735488</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Now let&#8217;s switch to a slightly different view of the above scenario, where I plot number of tweets against number of likes:</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-tweets-vs-likes.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/likes-vs-tweets/flowingdata-tweets-vs-likes.png" alt="FlowingData Tweets vs. Likes" /></a></p>

<p>We see that as popularity on Twitter increases, so too does popularity on Facebook &#8211; but at a slightly faster rate. (The form of the blue line plotted is roughly $\log(likes) = -3.87 + 1.70 \log(tweets)$.)</p>

<p>So instead of looking at the ratios above, to figure out which articles are popular on FB vs. Twitter, we could look at the residuals of the above plot. Posts with large positive residuals would be posts that are especially popular on FB, and posts with negative residuals would be posts that are especially popular on Twitter.</p>

<p>In practice, however, there wasn&#8217;t much difference between looking at residuals vs. ratios directly when using the datasets I had, so to keep things simple in the main discussion above, I stuck to ratios alone. Still, it&#8217;s another option which might be useful when looking at different questions or different sources of data, so just for completeness, here&#8217;s what the FlowingData results look like if we use residuals instead.</p>

<p>The 10 articles with the highest residuals (i.e., the articles most popular on Facebook):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Suppose you ask a bunch of users to rate a set of movies on a 0-100 scale. In classical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis">factor analysis</a>, you could then try to explain each movie and user in terms of a set of latent <em>factors</em>. For example, movies like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings might have strong associations with a latent science fiction and fantasy factor, and users who like Wall-E and Toy Story might have strong associations with a latent Pixar factor.</p>




<p>Restricted Boltzmann Machines essentially perform a <em>binary</em> version of factor analysis. (This is one way of thinking about RBMs; there are, of course, others, and lots of different ways to use RBMs, but I&#8217;ll adopt this approach for this post.) Instead of users rating a set of movies on a continuous scale, they simply tell you whether they like a movie or not, and the RBM will try to discover latent factors that can explain the activation of these movie choices.</p>




<p>More technically, a Restricted Boltzmann Machine is a <strong>stochastic neural network</strong> (<em>neural network</em> meaning we have neuron-like units whose binary activations depend on the neighbors they&#8217;re connected to; <em>stochastic</em> meaning these activations have a probabilistic element) consisting of:</p>




<ul>
<li>One layer of <strong>visible units</strong> (users&#8217; movie preferences whose states we know and set);</li>
<li>One layer of <strong>hidden units</strong> (the latent factors we try to learn); and</li>
<li>A bias unit (whose state is always on, and is a way of adjusting for the different inherent popularities of each movie).</li>
</ul>




<p>Furthermore, each visible unit is connected to all the hidden units (this connection is undirected, so each hidden unit is also connected to all the visible units), and the bias unit is connected to all the visible units and all the hidden units. To make learning easier, we restrict the network so that no visible unit is connected to any other visible unit and no hidden unit is connected to any other hidden unit.</p>




<p>For example, suppose we have a set of six movies (Harry Potter, Avatar, LOTR 3, Gladiator, Titanic, and Glitter) and we ask users to tell us which ones they want to watch. If we want to learn two latent units underlying movie preferences &#8211; for example, two natural groups in our set of six movies appear to be SF/fantasy (containing Harry Potter, Avatar, and LOTR 3) and Oscar winners (containing LOTR 3, Gladiator, and Titanic), so we might hope that our latent units will correspond to these categories &#8211; then our RBM would look like the following:</p>




<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/rbms/rbm-example.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/rbms/rbm-example.png" alt="RBM Example" /></a></p>




<p>(Note the resemblance to a factor analysis graphical model.)</p>




<h1>State Activation</h1>




<p>Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and neural networks in general, work by updating the states of some neurons given the states of others, so let&#8217;s talk about how the states of individual units change. Assuming we know the connection weights in our RBM (we&#8217;ll explain how to learn these below), to update the state of unit $i$:</p>




<ul>
<li>Compute the <strong>activation energy</strong> $a\_i = &#92;sum\_j w\_{ij} x\_j$ of unit $i$, where the sum runs over all units $j$ that unit $i$ is connected to, $w\_{ij}$ is the weight of the connection between $i$ and $j$, and $x\_j$ is the 0 or 1 state of unit $j$. In other words, all of unit $i$&#8217;s neighbors send it a message, and we compute the sum of all these messages.</li>
<li>Let $p\_i = &#92;sigma(a\_i)$, where $&#92;sigma(x) = 1/(1 + exp(-x))$ is the logistic function. Note that $p\_i$ is close to 1 for large positive activation energies, and $p\_i$ is close to 0 for negative activation energies.</li>
<li>We then turn unit $i$ on with probability $p\_i$, and turn it off with probability $1 - p\_i$.</li>
<li>(In layman&#8217;s terms, units that are positively connected to each other try to get each other to share the same state (i.e., be both on or off), while units that are negatively connected to each other are enemies that prefer to be in different states.)</li>
</ul>




<p>For example, let&#8217;s suppose our two hidden units really do correspond to SF/fantasy and Oscar winners.</p>




<ul>
<li>If Alice has told us her six binary preferences on our set of movies, we could then ask our RBM which of the hidden units her preferences activate (i.e., ask the RBM to explain her preferences in terms of latent factors). So the six movies send messages to the hidden units, telling them to update themselves. (Note that even if Alice has declared she wants to watch Harry Potter, Avatar, and LOTR 3, this doesn&#8217;t guarantee that the SF/fantasy hidden unit will turn on, but only that it will turn on with high <em>probability</em>. This makes a bit of sense: in the real world, Alice wanting to watch all three of those movies makes us highly suspect she likes SF/fantasy in general, but there&#8217;s a small chance she wants to watch them for other reasons. Thus, the RBM allows us to <em>generate</em> models of people in the messy, real world.)</li>
<li>Conversely, if we know that one person likes SF/fantasy (so that the SF/fantasy unit is on), we can then ask the RBM which of the movie units that hidden unit turns on (i.e., ask the RBM to generate a set of movie recommendations). So the hidden units send messages to the movie units, telling them to update their states. (Again, note that the SF/fantasy unit being on doesn&#8217;t guarantee that we&#8217;ll always recommend all three of Harry Potter, Avatar, and LOTR 3 because, hey, not everyone who likes science fiction liked Avatar.)</li>
</ul>




<h1>Learning Weights</h1>




<p>So how do we learn the connection weights in our network? Suppose we have a bunch of training examples, where each training example is a binary vector with six elements corresponding to a user&#8217;s movie preferences. Then for each epoch, do the following:</p>




<ul>
<li>Take a training example (a set of six movie preferences). Set the states of the visible units to these preferences.</li>
<li>Next, update the states of the hidden units using the logistic activation rule described above: for the $j$th hidden unit, compute its activation energy $a\_j = &#92;sum\_i w\_{ij} x\_i$, and set $x\_j$ to 1 with probability $&#92;sigma(a\_j)$ and to 0 with probability $1 - &#92;sigma(a\_j)$. Then for each edge $e\_{ij}$, compute $Positive(e\_{ij}) = x\_i \* x\_j$ (i.e., for each pair of units, measure whether they&#8217;re both on).</li>
<li>Now <strong>reconstruct</strong> the visible units in a similar manner: for each visible unit, compute its activation energy $a\_i$, and update its state. (Note that this <em>reconstruction</em> may not match the original preferences.) Then update the hidden units again, and compute $Negative(e\_{ij}) = x\_i \* x\_j$ for each edge.</li>
<li>Update the weight of each edge $e\_{ij}$ by setting $w\_{ij} = w\_{ij} + L \* (Positive(e\_{ij}) - Negative(e\_{ij}))$, where $L$ is a learning rate.</li>
<li>Repeat over all training examples.</li>
</ul>




<p>Continue until the network converges (i.e., the error between the training examples and their reconstructions falls below some threshold) or we reach some maximum number of epochs.</p>




<p>Why does this update rule make sense? Note that</p>




<ul>
<li>In the first phase, $Positive(e\_{ij})$ measures the association between the $i$th and $j$th unit that we <em>want</em> the network to learn from our training examples;</li>
<li>In the &#8220;reconstruction&#8221; phase, where the RBM generates the states of visible units based on its hypotheses about the hidden units alone, $Negative(e\_{ij})$ measures the association that the network <em>itself</em> generates (or &#8220;daydreams&#8221; about) when no units are fixed to training data.</li>
</ul>




<p>So by adding $Positive(e\_{ij}) - Negative(e\_{ij})$ to each edge weight, we&#8217;re helping the network&#8217;s daydreams better match the reality of our training examples.</p>




<p>(You may hear this update rule called <strong>contrastive divergence</strong>, which is basically a funky term for &#8220;approximate gradient descent&#8221;.)</p>




<h1>Examples</h1>




<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/echen/restricted-boltzmann-machines">a simple RBM implementation</a> in Python (the code is heavily commented, so take a look if you&#8217;re still a little fuzzy on how everything works), so let&#8217;s use it to walk through some examples.</p>




<p>First, I trained the RBM using some fake data.</p>




<ul>
<li>Alice: (Harry Potter = 1, Avatar = 1, LOTR 3 = 1, Gladiator = 0, Titanic = 0, Glitter = 0). Big SF/fantasy fan.</li>
<li>Bob: (Harry Potter = 1, Avatar = 0, LOTR 3 = 1, Gladiator = 0, Titanic = 0, Glitter = 0). SF/fantasy fan, but doesn&#8217;t like Avatar.</li>
<li>Carol: (Harry Potter = 1, Avatar = 1, LOTR 3 = 1, Gladiator = 0, Titanic = 0, Glitter = 0). Big SF/fantasy fan.</li>
<li>David: (Harry Potter = 0, Avatar = 0, LOTR 3 = 1, Gladiator = 1, Titanic = 1, Glitter = 0). Big Oscar winners fan.</li>
<li>Eric:  (Harry Potter = 0, Avatar = 0, LOTR 3 = 1, Gladiator = 1, Titanic = 1, Glitter = 0). Oscar winners fan, except for Titanic.</li>
<li>Fred: (Harry Potter = 0, Avatar = 0, LOTR 3 = 1, Gladiator = 1, Titanic = 1, Glitter = 0). Big Oscar winners fan.</li>
</ul>




<p>The network learned the following weights:</p>




<pre><code>                 Bias Unit       Hidden 1        Hidden 2
Bias Unit       -0.08257658     -0.19041546      1.57007782
Harry Potter    -0.82602559     -7.08986885      4.96606654
Avatar          -1.84023877     -5.18354129      2.27197472
LOTR 3           3.92321075      2.51720193      4.11061383
Gladiator        0.10316995      6.74833901     -4.00505343
Titanic         -0.97646029      3.25474524     -5.59606865
Glitter         -4.44685751     -2.81563804     -2.91540988
</code></pre>




<p>Note that the first hidden unit seems to correspond to the Oscar winners, and the second hidden unit seems to correspond to the SF/fantasy movies, just as we were hoping.</p>




<p>What happens if we give the RBM a new user, George, who has (Harry Potter = 0, Avatar = 0, LOTR 3 = 0, Gladiator = 1, Titanic = 1, Glitter = 0) as his preferences? It turns the Oscar winners unit on (but not the SF/fantasy unit), correctly guessing that George probably likes movies that are Oscar winners.</p>




<p>What happens if we activate only the SF/fantasy unit, and run the RBM a bunch of different times? In my trials, it turned on Harry Potter, Avatar, and LOTR 3 three times; it turned on Avatar and LOTR 3, but not Harry Potter, once; and it turned on Harry Potter and LOTR 3, but not Avatar, twice. Note that, based on our training examples, these generated preferences do indeed match what we might expect real SF/fantasy fans want to watch.</p>




<h1>Modifications</h1>




<p>I tried to keep the connection-learning algorithm I described above pretty simple, so here are some modifications that often appear in practice:</p>




<ul>
<li>Above, $Negative(e\_{ij})$ was determined by taking the product of the $i$th and $j$th units after reconstructing the visible units <em>once</em> and then updating the hidden units again. We could also take the product after some larger number of reconstructions (i.e., repeat updating the visible units, then the hidden units, then the visible units again, and so on); this is slower, but describes the network&#8217;s daydreams more accurately.</li>
<li>Instead of using $Positive(e\_{ij})=x\_i \* x\_j$, where $x\_i$ and $x\_j$ are binary 0 or 1 <em>states</em>, we could also let $x\_i$ and/or $x\_j$ be activation <em>probabilities</em>. Similarly for $Negative(e\_{ij})$.</li>
<li>We could penalize larger edge weights, in order to get a sparser or more regularized model.</li>
<li>When updating edge weights, we could use a momentum factor: we would add to each edge a weighted sum of the current step as described above (i.e., $L \* (Positive(e\_{ij}) - Negative(e\_{ij})$) and the step previously taken.</li>
<li>Instead of using only one training example in each epoch, we could use <em>batches</em> of examples in each epoch, and only update the network&#8217;s weights after passing through all the examples in the batch. This can speed up the learning by taking advantage of fast matrix-multiplication algorithms.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Should evolution be taught in schools? Go <a href="http://miss-usa-evolution.heroku.com">here</a> to visualize what the Miss USA contestants think.</p>

<h1>The Visualization</h1>

<p>Education is an area sorely in need of data crunching, so when I ran across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBv2CFTSWU&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=56">an amusing video</a> satirizing the Miss USA contestants&#8217; thoughts on teaching evolution, I thought it would be fun to transcribe <a href="youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkBmhM0R2A0&amp;feature=youtu.be#at=41">the original video</a> and visualize the data.</p>

<p>So after some tedious transcription, I built <a href="http://miss-usa-evolution.heroku.com">this app</a> to categorize and visualize the responses in various ways. (Mouseover states to see transcriptions, and click to jump to each contestant&#8217;s response in the video.)</p>

<h1>Example Maps</h1>

<p>Here are some examples of the generated maps.</p>

<p>First, we can look at which contestants believe in evolution (Miss California &#8211; the winner! &#8211; is the only contestant who explicitly states she believes in evolution; the red states explicitly state they do not believe in evolution; the grey states don&#8217;t make clear what they believe):</p>

<p><a href="http://miss-usa-evolution.heroku.com/?column=believes"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/miss-usa-evolution/believe-evolution.png" alt="Believe Evolution" /></a></p>

<p>We can also see which contestants believe evolution should be taught in schools (green states say yes, red states say no, grey states say maybe or that it should be a choice):</p>

<p><a href="http://miss-usa-evolution.heroku.com/?column=should_teach"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/miss-usa-evolution/teach-evolution.png" alt="Teach Evolution" /></a></p>

<p>Here is a rough Darwin-friendliness score I assigned to each response (worst in dark red to best in dark green):</p>

<p><a href="http://miss-usa-evolution.heroku.com/?column=score"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/miss-usa-evolution/score.png" alt="Score" /></a></p>

<p>This map shows which contestants believe schools should teach creationism:</p>

<p><a href="http://miss-usa-evolution.heroku.com/?column=teach_creationism"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/miss-usa-evolution/teach-creationism.png" alt="Teach Creationism" /></a></p>

<p>And this map shows which contestants mention science in their response:</p>

<p><a href="http://miss-usa-evolution.heroku.com/?column=mentions_science"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/miss-usa-evolution/mention-science.png" alt="Mention Science" /></a></p>

<p>So while there aren&#8217;t any striking patterns (I was hoping for a bright swath of red across the most religious states), the data&#8217;s still fun to look at, and it&#8217;s helpful to see that Alabama, whose <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkBmhM0R2A0&amp;feature=youtu.be#at=42">strongly anti-evolution</a> candidate is the only one colored red in both of the first two maps, does seem to be a bit of an outlier with respect to the rest of the nation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>LDA-based Email Browser</h1>

<p>Earlier this month, several thousand emails from Sarah Palin&#8217;s time as governor of Alaska were <a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2011/sarahs-inbox/">released</a>. The emails weren&#8217;t organized in any fashion, though, so to make them easier to browse, I&#8217;ve been working on some topic modeling (in particular, using latent Dirichlet allocation) to separate the documents into different groups.</p>

<p>I threw up <a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/">a simple demo app</a> to view the organized documents <a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/">here</a>.</p>

<h1>What is Latent Dirichlet Allocation?</h1>

<p>Briefly, given a set of documents, LDA tries to learn the latent topics underlying the set. It represents each document as a mixture of topics (generated from a Dirichlet distribution), each of which emits words with a certain probability.</p>

<p>For example, given the sentence &#8220;I listened to Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga on the radio while driving around in my car&#8221;, an LDA model might represent this sentence as 75% about music (a topic which, say, emits the words <em>Bieber</em> with 10% probability, <em>Gaga</em> with 5% probability, <em>radio</em> with 1% probability, and so on) and 25% about cars (which might emit <em>driving</em> with 15% probability and <em>cars</em> with 10% probability).</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with latent semantic analysis, you can think of LDA as a generative version. (For a more in-depth explanation, I wrote an introduction to LDA <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/">here</a>.)</p>

<h1>Sarah Palin Email Topics</h1>

<p>Here&#8217;s a sample of the topics learnt by the model, as well as the top words for each topic. (Names, of course, are based on my own interpretation.)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/topics/24"><strong>Wildlife/BP Corrosion</strong></a>: game, fish, moose, wildlife, hunting, bears, polar, bear, subsistence, management, area, board, hunt, wolves, control, department, year, use, wolf, habitat, hunters, caribou, program, denby, fishing, …</li>
<li><a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/topics/0"><strong>Energy/Fuel/Oil/Mining</strong></a>: energy, fuel, costs, oil, alaskans, prices, cost, nome, now, high, being, home, public, power, mine, crisis, price, resource, need, community, fairbanks, rebate, use, mining, villages, …</li>
<li><a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/topics/19"><strong>Trig/Family/Inspiration</strong></a>: family, web, mail, god, son, from, congratulations, children, life, child, down, trig, baby, birth, love, you, syndrome, very, special, bless, old, husband, years, thank, best, …</li>
<li><a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/topics/6"><strong>Gas</strong></a>: gas, oil, pipeline, agia, project, natural, north, producers, companies, tax, company, energy, development, slope, production, resources, line, gasline, transcanada, said, billion, plan, administration, million, industry, …</li>
<li><a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/topics/12"><strong>Education/Waste</strong></a>: school, waste, education, students, schools, million, read, email, market, policy, student, year, high, news, states, program, first, report, business, management, bulletin, information, reports, 2008, quarter, …</li>
<li><a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/topics/15"><strong>Presidential Campaign/Elections</strong></a>: mail, web, from, thank, you, box, mccain, sarah, very, good, great, john, hope, president, sincerely, wasilla, work, keep, make, add, family, republican, support, doing, p.o, …</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s a sample email from the wildlife topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/emails/6719"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/palin-browser/wildlife-email.png" alt="Wildlife Email" /></a></p>

<p>I also thought the classification for <a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/emails/12900">this email</a> was really neat: the LDA model labeled it as 10% in the <a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/topics/15">Presidential Campaign/Elections</a> topic and 90% in the <a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/topics/24">Wildlife</a> topic, and it&#8217;s precisely a wildlife-based protest against Palin as a choice for VP:</p>

<p><a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/emails/12900"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/palin-browser/wildlife-vp.png" alt="Wildlife-VP Protest" /></a></p>

<h1>Future Analysis</h1>

<p>In a future post, I&#8217;ll perhaps see if we can glean any interesting patterns from the email topics. For example, for a quick graph now, if we look at the percentage of emails in the <a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/topics/19">Trig/Family/Inspiration topic</a> across time, we see that there&#8217;s a spike in April 2008 &#8211; exactly (and unsurprisingly) the month in which Trig was born.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruJ76-o5lxU">an adorable scene</a> in <em>WALL-E</em> where, unable to decide whether a spork belongs with his spoon collection or fork collection, WALL-E enters an infinite loop and spontaneously combusts*.</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/spork/spork-indecision-2.gif"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/spork/spork-indecision-2.gif" alt="Spork" /></a></p>

<p>This led me to the following timeless question: is a spork more spoon or fork?</p>

<p>To answer, I did a little digging. First, I pulled images of spoons and forks from <a href="http://www.bing.com/images">Bing</a> (natch) and used these to train a spoon-vs.-fork SVM (using the excellent <a href="http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/">scikit-learn</a> package).</p>

<p>Using leave-one-out cross-validation, the classifier showed roughly 85% accuracy: 4 out of 20 spoons were misclassified as forks, and 2 out of 20 forks were misclassified as spoons. Not bad, considering the limited dataset and lack of tuning.</p>

<p>Finally, I applied the classifier to my spork images.</p>

<p>The results? 2 out of 20 sporks were classified as forks and the remaining 18 were classified as spoons, thereby definitively proving that <strong>a spork is 10% fork and 90% spoon</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been a <a href="www.cs.washington.edu/homes/brun/pubs/pubs/Kiddon11.pdf">fun paper</a> on <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=that's%20what%20she%20said">That&#8217;s What She Said</a> identification making the rounds recently, so I spent some time over the weekend building my own classifier.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> A simple unigram Naive Bayes model works pretty well, with performance on the lines of 0.969 precision and 0.823 recall. There&#8217;s a demo <a href="http://twss-classifier.heroku.com/">here</a>. I also ran the classifier over some fairy tale text.</p>

<h1>Naive Bayes Classifier</h1>

<p>To start, I used a super simple Naive Bayes classifier, trained on unigrams (with add-one smoothing). (See the appendix at the end for details.)</p>

<h2>Unigram vs. Bigram Model</h2>

<p>Here are the most predictive features, after training a Naive Bayes model with unigrams:</p>

<pre><code>unigram         p(twss|unigram)
pull            0.9724889822144924
bigger          0.9614677503890157
wet             0.959004244327654
hard            0.9527628206878138
stick           0.9505783678914388
hole            0.9443870318715991
oh              0.9432941279908561
replied         0.943294127990856
fast            0.943294127990856
longer          0.9397415371025485
</code></pre>

<p>Just to compare, here are some of the most predictive features in a bigram model (I added START and END tokens to the beginning and end of each sentence, in order to have some contextual features):</p>

<pre><code>bigram          p(twss|bigram)
it in           0.9801434151851175
START wow       0.9705079286853889
START oh        0.9473580156961879
its too         0.9350522640444204
pull out        0.9187779331523677
too big         0.9187779331523677
START man       0.9113755525471394
hard END        0.9113755525471394
put it          0.9071442285463515
that thing      0.9024886021363793
stick it        0.9024886021363793
my god          0.9024886021363793
go in           0.8916207044791409
START ugh       0.8916207044791409
make it         0.8916207044791409
its so          0.8916207044791409
</code></pre>

<p>Amusingly, sentences starting with <em>wow</em>, <em>oh</em>, and <em>ugh</em>, tend to be good candidates for TWSS sentences, as well as sentences containing <em>it&#8217;s too</em> and <em>it&#8217;s so</em>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a precision-recall curve comparing the two models. We see that, on our datasets, a unigram classifier handily beats a bigram classifier:</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/twss/precision-recall.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/twss/precision-recall.png" alt="Precision-Recall" /></a></p>

<h1>Darling it&#8217;s better</h1>

<p>Although our classifier gives excellent performance on our test set, one question is how well it generalizes to other sources of data.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have another set of positive examples to draw from, but I took a set of fairy tales on Project Gutenberg to form a new batch of negative examples. On this new set of fairy tale sentences, the classifier misclassified only 81 out of 912 of the examples (assuming they should all be classified as &#8220;not TWSS&#8221;), which is a pretty low error rate of 8.89%.</p>

<p>What do these misclassifications look like? Here are some of the false positives it made:</p>

<h2>Aladdin</h2>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;The African magician carries it carefully wrapt up in his bosom,&#8221; said the princess; &#8220;and this I can assure you, because he pulled it out before me, and showed it to me in triumph.&#8221;</li>
<li>It is vanished; but I had no concern in its removal.</li>
<li>&#8220;My son,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what a man you are to do such surprising things always in the twinkling of an eye!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Sire,&#8221; replied Aladdin, &#8220;I have not the least reason to complain of your conduct, since you did nothing but what your duty required.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;With your leave, mother,&#8221; replied Aladdin, &#8220;I shall now take care how I sell a lamp which may be so serviceable both to you and me.&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/twss/aladdin.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/twss/aladdin.png" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/twss/aladdin.png" /></a></p>

<h2>Hansel and Gretel</h2>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do let me go and see the hunt; I cannot restrain myself.&#8221;</li>
<li>When they awoke it was dark night, and poor Grethel began to cry, and said, &#8220;Oh, how shall we get out of the wood?&#8221; But Hansel comforted her.</li>
<li>&#8220;But remember,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I must lock the cottage door against those huntsmen, so when you come back in the evening, and knock, I shall not admit you, unless you say, &#8216;Dear little sister let me in.&#8217;</li>
</ul>


<h2>Snow White</h2>

<ul>
<li>One was too long, another too short; so she tried them all till she came to the seventh, and that was so comfortable that she laid herself down, and was soon fast asleep.</li>
<li>&#8220;Oh yes, I will try,&#8221; said Snow-white.</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that a lot of these really are TWSS sentences! (Now we know where <a href="http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/mermaid.asp">those Disney artists</a> got their inspiration.) So the classifier appears to generalize surprisingly well.</p>

<h1>A Demo</h1>

<p>I created <a href="http://twss-classifier.heroku.com/">a small Sinatra app</a> to play around with the classifier, and deployed it <a href="http://twss-classifier.heroku.com/">here</a>. I also put the code <a href="https://github.com/echen/twss-classifier">on Github</a>.</p>

<h1>Appendix: Details</h1>

<h2>Datasets</h2>

<p>To grab some TWSS examples, my first thought was to turn to <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=twss">twitter</a>. However, the twitter data turned out to be incredibly noisy (lots of junk obscuring not terribly funny examples), so taking a cue from the K&amp;B paper, I pulled data from three sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, I scraped <a href="http://twssstories.com">twss stories</a> for positive training data (sentences for which a TWSS response is appropriate). Since only the last part in quotes from each submission is truly relevant to being a TWSS, I kept the quote and threw away the rest of each submission.</li>
<li>Next, I scraped <a href="http://textsfromlastnight.com">Texts from Last Night</a> and <a href="http://www.fmylife.com">FMyLife</a> for negative training data. Since TWSS jokes are usually made in response to <em>sentences</em> (the last sentence you say), I split each submission into sentences, and each sentence formed a single negative training example.</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, I normalized each sentence by converting to lowercase and removing any punctuation.</p>

<h2>The Algorithm</h2>

<p>To train and test the classifier, I used the examples I gathered to form training and test sets, each consisting of:</p>

<ul>
<li>1000 positive examples from twss stories.</li>
<li>500 negative examples from Texts from Last Night.</li>
<li>500 negative examples from FMyLife.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Performance of the Unigram Model</h2>

<p>Since we want to optimize for precision (we hope the things we classify as TWSS sentences really are TWSS sentences) over recall (it&#8217;s fine if we don&#8217;t always respond TWSS to every TWSS sentence), let&#8217;s use 0.99 probability as our threshold for classifying a sentence as TWSS. (This is equivalent to setting a low prior for the probability of being a TWSS.)</p>

<p>With this threshold, a unigram Naive Bayes classifier has the following performance on a test set:</p>

<ul>
<li>True positives: 823</li>
<li>False negatives: 177</li>
<li>True negatives: 974</li>
<li>False positives: 26</li>
<li>Precision = 0.969</li>
<li>Recall = 0.823</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(See a demo <a href="http://babel-fett.heroku.com/">here</a>.)</p>

<p>While working on a Twitter sentiment analysis project, I ran into the problem of needing to filter out all non-English tweets. (Asking the Twitter API for English-only tweets doesn&#8217;t seem to work, as it nonetheless returns tweets in Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, and a couple other languages.)</p>

<p>Since I didn&#8217;t have any labeled data, I thought it would be fun to build an <strong>unsupervised</strong> language classifier. In particular, using an EM algorithm to build a naive Bayes model of English vs. non-English n-gram probabilities turned out to work quite well, so here&#8217;s a description.</p>

<h1>EM Algorithm</h1>

<p>Let&#8217;s recall the naive Bayes algorithm: given a tweet (a set of <em>character</em> n-grams), we estimate its language to be the language $L$ that maximizes</p>

<p>$$P(language = L | ngrams) \propto P(ngrams | language = L) P(language = L)$$</p>

<p>Thus, we need to estimate $P(ngram | language = L)$ and $P(language = L)$.</p>

<p>This would be easy <strong>if we knew the language of each tweet</strong>, since we could estimate</p>

<ul>
<li>$P(xyz| language = English)$ as #(number of times &#8220;xyz&#8221; is a trigram in the English tweets) / #(total trigrams in the English tweets)</li>
<li>$P(language = English)$ as the proportion of English tweets.</li>
</ul>


<p>Or, it would also be easy <strong>if we knew the n-gram probabilities for each language</strong>, since we could use Bayes&#8217; theorem to compute the language <em>probabilities</em> for each tweet, and then take a weighted variant of the previous paragraph.</p>

<p><strong>The problem is that we know neither of these.</strong> So what the EM algorithm says is that that we can simply <strong>guess</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pretend we know the language of each tweet (by randomly assigning them at the beginning).</li>
<li>Using this guess, we can compute the n-gram probabilities for each language.</li>
<li>Using the n-gram probabilities for each language, we can recompute the language probabilities of each tweet.</li>
<li>Using these recomputed language probabilities, we can recompute the n-gram probabilities.</li>
<li>And so on, recomputing the language probabilities and n-gram probabilities over and over. While our guesses will be off in the beginning, the probabilities will eventually converge to (locally) minimize the likelihood. (In my tests, my language detector would sometimes correctly converge to an English detector, and sometimes it would converge to an English-and-Dutch detector.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>EM Analogy for the Layman</h2>

<p>Why does this work? Suppose you suddenly move to New York, and you want a way to differentiate between tourists and New Yorkers based on their activities. Initially, you don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s a tourist and who&#8217;s a New Yorker, and you don&#8217;t know which are touristy activities and which are not. So you randomly place people into two groups A and B. (You randomly assign all tweets to a language)</p>

<p>Now, given all the people in group A, you notice that a large number of them visit the Statue of Liberty; similarly, you notice that a large number of people in group B walk really quickly. (You notice that one set of words often has the n-gram &#8220;ing&#8221;, and that another set of words often has the n-gram &#8220;ias&#8221;; that is, you fix the language probabilities for each tweet, and recompute the n-gram probabilities for each language.)</p>

<p>So you start to put people visiting the Statue of Liberty in group A, and you start to put fast walkers in group B. (You fix the n-gram probabilities for each language, and recompute the language probabilities for each tweet.)</p>

<p>With your new A and B groups, you notice more differentiating factors: group A people tend to carry along cameras, and group B people tend to be more finance-savvy.</p>

<p>So you start to put camera-carrying folks in group A, and finance-savvy folks in group B.</p>

<p>And so on. Eventually, you settle on two groups of people and differentiating activities: people who walk slowly and visit the Statue of Liberty, and busy-looking people who walk fast and don&#8217;t visit. Assuming there are more native New Yorkers than tourists, you can then guess that the natives are the larger group.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>

<p>I wrote some Ruby code to implement the above algorithm, and trained it on half a million tweets, using English and &#8220;not English&#8221; as my two languages. The results looked surprisingly good from just eyeballing:</p>

<p><a href="https://img.skitch.com/20110303-qfrnb8gstgheh4xech4iutfskd.jpg"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110303-qfrnb8gstgheh4xech4iutfskd.jpg" alt="Example Results" /></a></p>

<p>But in order to get some hard metrics and to tune parameters (e.g., n-gram size), I needed a labeled dataset. So I pulled a set of English-language and Spanish-language documents from Project Gutenberg, and split them to form training and test sets (the training set consisted of 2000 lines of English and 1000 lines of Spanish, and  1000 lines of English and 1000 lines of Spanish for the test set).</p>

<p>Trained on bigrams, the detector resulted in:</p>

<ul>
<li>991 true positives (English lines correctly classified as English)</li>
<li>9 false negatives (English lines incorrectly classified as Spanish</li>
<li>11 false positives (Spanish lines incorrectly classified as English)</li>
<li>989 true negatives (Spanish lines correctly classified as English)</li>
</ul>


<p>for a precision of 0.989 and a recall of 0.991.</p>

<p>Trained on trigrams, the detector resulted in:</p>

<ul>
<li>992 true positives</li>
<li>8 false negatives</li>
<li>10 false positives</li>
<li>990 true negatives</li>
</ul>


<p>for a precision of 0.990 and a recall of 0.992.</p>

<p>Also, when I looked at the sentences the detector was making errors on, I saw that they almost always consisted of only one or two words (e.g., the incorrectly classified sentences were lines like &#8220;inmortal&#8221;, &#8220;autumn&#8221;, and &#8220;salir&#8221;). So the detector pretty much never made a mistake on a normal sentence!</p>

<h1>Code/Demo</h1>

<p>I put the code on <a href="https://github.com/echen/unsupervised-language-identification">my Github account</a>, and a quick <a href="http://babel-fett.heroku.com/">demo app</a>, trained on trigrams from tweets with lang=&#8221;en&#8221; according to the Twitter API, is <a href="http://babel-fett.heroku.com/">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aaron Koblin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thesheepmarket.com/">Sheep Market</a> visualization is an awesome use of Mechanical Turk. But it&#8217;d be even more awesome if the grid were <em>ordered</em>, so I decided to try projecting the sheep onto two dimensions.</p>

<h1>Principal Sheep Components</h1>

<p>After screenshotting the first 50 sheep from the market and normalizing their size and color, here&#8217;s what a PCA projection looks like (<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/eigensheep.png">click</a> for a larger view):</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/eigensheep.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/eigensheep.png" alt="Projected Sheep" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how the stroke widths get thicker as we move to the right (i.e., <strong>the first principal component seems to measure the blackness of the sheep</strong>), and the amount of wool on the sheep&#8217;s body increases as we move up (i.e., <strong>the second principal component seems to measure the wooliness of the sheep</strong>).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also pretty neat how all the sheep with black heads and black legs (sheep 35, 16, 32, 31, and 19) get clumped together:</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/eigensheep-black-heads.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/eigensheep-black-heads.png" alt="Projected Sheep, Black Heads/Legs Circled" /></a></p>

<p>And I think the sheep on the left (next to and inside the dense cluster) seem much more poorly drawn &#8211; they look more like camels, dogs, unicorns, or bugs than actual sheep.</p>

<h1>Code</h1>

<p>In a bit more detail, I used the poor man&#8217;s Mechanical Turk (myself) to screenshot the first 50 sheep from the market, trying to hug the sheep as closely as possible to ensure proper alignment. Next, I used the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a> to resize the images to 150x150px, convert them to grayscale, and flatten them into the rows of a matrix.</p>

<p>In case anyone else wants to play with the sheep images, I put the <a href="https://github.com/echen/eigensheep">code</a> on my <a href="https://github.com/echen/eigensheep">Github</a> account.</p>
