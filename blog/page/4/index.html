  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant approach to the Evasiveness Conjecture (see the original paper <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/index/R521072311641L41.pdf">here</a>) is an epic application of pure mathematics to computer science. I&#8217;ll give an overview of the approach here, and probably try to add some more information on the problem in other posts.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> The KSS approach provides an algebraic-topological attack to a combinatorial hypothesis, and reduces a graph complexity problem to a problem of contractibility and (not) finding fixed points.</p>

<p>First, the Evasiveness Conjecture states that any (non-trivial) monotone graph property is evasive. In other words, if you&#8217;re trying to figure out whether an undirected n-vertex graph satisfies a certain property (e.g., whether the graph contains a triangle or is connected), and this property is monotone (meaning that if you add more edges to the graph, then it still satisfies the property), then if all you&#8217;re allowed to do is ask questions of the form &#8220;Is edge (i, j) in the graph?&#8221;, then you need to query for every single edge before you can determine whether the graph satisfies the property or not. For example, if you want to figure out whether a graph G contains a clique of size 5, then you need to know whether each of the n(n-1)/2 possible edges is in the graph or not before you can answer for certain.</p>

<p>Next, given any monotone graph property on n-vertex graphs, we can associate it with a simplicial complex S (basically, an n-dimensional structure formed by gluing together a bunch of hypertriangles), by taking the complex to be the set of all n-vertex graphs that don&#8217;t satisfy the property.</p>

<p>Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant then prove that if a monotone graph property is not evasive, then its associated simplicial complex is contractible, and thus (by the Lefschetz Fixed-Point theorem) any auto-simplicial map on the complex (a function from the complex to itself that preserves faces) has a fixed point.</p>

<p>Thus, we can prove that a monotone graph property is evasive by finding a simplicial map that has no fixed point (which we can do by showing that no orbit of the map is a face of the complex). This approach has been used to prove things like the evasiveness of graph properties when the number of vertices is prime or a prime power, and the evasiveness of all bipartite graph properties.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In making its product recommendations, Amazon makes heavy use of an item-to-item collaborative filtering approach. This essentially means that for each item X, Amazon builds a neighborhood of related items S(X); whenever you buy/look at an item, Amazon then recommends you items from that item&#8217;s neighborhood. That&#8217;s why when you sign in to Amazon and look at the front page, your recommendations are mostly of the form &#8220;You viewed&#8230; Customers who viewed this also viewed&#8230;&#8221;.</p>

<h1>Other approaches.</h1>

<p>The item-to-item approach can be contrasted to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A user-to-user collaborative filtering approach</strong>. This finds users similar to you (e.g., it could find users who bought a lot of items in common with you), and suggest items that they&#8217;ve bought but you haven&#8217;t.</li>
<li><strong>A global, latent factorization approach</strong>. Rather than looking at individual items in isolation (in the item-to-item approach, if you and I both buy a book X, Amazon will make essentially the same recommendations based on X, regardless of what we&#8217;ve bought in the past), a global approach would look at all the items you&#8217;ve bought, and try to detect properties that characterize what you like. For example, if you buy a lot of science fiction books and also a lot of romance books, a global-approach algorithm might try to recommend you books with both science fiction and romance elements.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Pros/cons of the item-to-item approach:</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros over the user-to-user approach</strong>: Amazon (and most applications) has many more users than items, so it&#8217;s computationally simpler to find similar items than it is to find similar users. Finding similar users is also a difficult algorithmic task, since individual users often have a very wide range of tastes, but individual items usually belong to relatively few genres.</li>
<li><strong>Pros over the factorization approach</strong>: Simpler to implement. Faster to update recommendations: as soon as you buy a new book, Amazon can make a new recommendation in the item-to-item approach, whereas a factorization approach would have to wait until the factorization has been recomputed. The item-to-item approach can also be more easily leveraged in several areas, not only in the recommendations made to you, but also in the &#8220;similar items/other customers also bought&#8221; section when you look at a particular item.</li>
<li><strong>Cons of the item-to-item approach</strong>: You don&#8217;t get very much diversity or surprise in item-to-item recommendations, so recommendations tend to be kind of &#8220;obvious&#8221; and boring.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How to find similar items</h1>

<p>Since the item-to-item approach makes crucial use of similar items, here&#8217;s a high-level view of how to do it. First, associate each item with the set of users who have bought/looked at it. The similarity between any two items could then be a normalized measure of the number of users they have in common (i.e., the Jaccard index) or the cosine distance between the two items (imagine each item as a vector, with a 1 in the ith element if user i has bought it, and 0 otherwise).</p>
