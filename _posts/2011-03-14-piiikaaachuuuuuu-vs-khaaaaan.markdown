This is a fun image I found onÂ [Neil Kodner's blog](http://www.neilkodner.com/2011/01/world-cup-2010-analysis-of-95gb-of-tweets-containing-goal/):

But I've never actually watched any of the Star Trek movies, so I decided to recreate the graph with Pikachu instead:

Here's a smoothed version to better compare the counts between different letters:

Unsurprisingly, people like to elongate the "u" in "pikachu" a lot better than they like to elongate the "a" and "i", though I'm surprised just how many "pikachuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"s are out there.
